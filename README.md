# Our Story
We started back in math class, it was September, I was bored in class and wanted to create a games website where my friends could enjoy fun games, *then I created the first website ever made by a student in the school*, my website reigned for months, until, a person named Bentley "Bdawg" Barnes created his website. It was great, but his had movies and lots of people would overuse it, which led to his main site being ~~blocked~~. Unblocked Games 44 is here to take over with more games and better quality control, at **Unblocked Games 44**, it is quality over quantity. Amen!

Even with our small team, we try our best to add games every day! We are always looking for away around the system and make your day a little bit better.
